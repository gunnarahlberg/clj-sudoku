# Introduction to clj-sudoku

Peter Norvig's implementation of the Sudoku puzzle can be found at 
http://norvig.com/sudoku.html and is an interesting comparison to Ron Jeffries implementation - all of this is described in https://gigamonkeys.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/coders-unit-testing/. Of which got me interested - what is it like to implement this in clojure? Any benefits? What is it like to write unit tests ? How many lines of code? How easy to write? To understand? To make a user interface? Can we use protocols for anything useful? Clojurscript for web application? Core.logic for heavy lifting? Core.async for communication?
